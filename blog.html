        <h2 style="color: darkred;">WHAT IS BLOG ?</h2>
        “Blog” is an abbreviated version of “weblog,” which is a term used to describe websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information. A blog features diary-type commentary and links to articles on other websites, usually presented as a list of entries in reverse chronological order. Blogs range from the personal to the political, and can focus on one narrow subject or a whole range of subjects.

        Many blogs focus on a particular topic, such as web
        design, home staging, sports, or mobile technology. Some are more eclectic, presenting links to all types of other sites. And others are more like personal journals, presenting the author’s daily life and thoughts.

        Generally speaking (although there are exceptions), blogs tend to have a few things in common: <br>
     <p></p>
        *)  A main content area with articles listed chronologically, newest on top. Often, the articles are organized into categories.An archive of older <br>
*)A way for people to leave comments about the articles. <br>
*)A list of links to other related sites, sometimes called a “blogroll”.

 <h3>WHAT IS A “BLOGGER”?</h3>
A blogger is a person who owns or runs a blog or a person who maintains the blog. That is, posting articles or new posts, information, sharing the most up-to-date news, opinions and case studies to name but a few. Such entries are known as blog posts.

 <h3 style="color: darkviolet;">COMMENTS</h3>
 Want an interactive website? Wouldn’t it be nice if the readers of a website could leave comments, tips or impressions about the site or a specific article? With blogs, they can! Posting comments is one of the most exciting features of blogs.

 Most blogs have a method to allow visitors to leave comments. There are also nifty ways for authors of other blogs to leave comments without even visiting the blog! Called “pingbacks” or “trackbacks“, they can inform other bloggers whenever they cite an article from another site in their own articles. All this ensures that online conversations can be maintained painlessly among various site users and websites.
